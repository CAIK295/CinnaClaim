This is a bukkit plugin developed for the CinnaCraft server.It is released under the following terms:- You're allowed to do whatever you want to do with the code, just keep the credits.- Don't redistribute your modified code without giving credits to the original creators. (CinnaCrew is fine).The purpose of the plugin is:- To allow users to claim world-guard regions, and thus becoming owners of it.- To allow users owning a region add their friends to it, so that they become members in that region.- Admins can use /cc setsize <intGoesHere> in a region, and claiming that region will cost that many points.- Users only get one point, and as of now there's no way of getting more points, unless modifying the SQLite database.This will also be working together with the CinnaEconomy plugin to allow users to buy more plots.
